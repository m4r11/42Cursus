###### Foreword
```
All work is being developed under the strict guidelines of the school,  
and exclusive norm.  
The threshold to pass any project is 100%, 
We may attempt to validate as many times we want.  
Most of libc functions are ** forbidden ** thus our own implementation  
of basic funtionalities.  
```
